# Remote OCP Container Terminal (ROCT)

This solution uses a pre-configured Ubuntu container image to build a remote environment in OpenShift cluster with command line tools from several cloud vendors: IBM¬Æ Cloud, Red Hat¬Æ OpenShift¬Æ, Kubectl, Helm, etc.

The primary goal of this solution is to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code's Remote Container extension to remote connect to a Linux environment in an OpenShift cluster.  

The solution integrates with IBM File or Block storage provisioner (for managed-hosted Classic OpenShift cluster) and NFS provisioner (for Technology Zone's Classic OpenShift cluster). The integration with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) is forthcoming.

üìù For the initial setup, this solution assumes you already have `oc`, `kubectl` client available on the system path and VS Code installed (Mac/Windows/Linux).

1. From VS Code Marketplace, install Microsoft's [Kubernetes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/kubernetes#_install-the-kubernetes-extension) and [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extensions. 
2. Click on VS Code's Kubernetes extension icon. Drop-down the cluster with roct. Drop-down Workloads - Pods. Right-click `roct-0` pod and select Attach VS Code.
3. Above mentioned step opens up a new VS Code window. The extension will install some binaries on the remote container. Wait for the installation to finish and then open a folder to `/home/demo/` directory. Open a Terminal and type `bash` to switch to the bash prompt.
4. Log in to OpenShift `oc login ...`
